# Group_E_MetalBirds

Title: Metal Birds
Description: In this project, we plan to examine the patterns of flights across various airlines in the United States. We are interested in common flight patterns that airlines may take (since some airlines “own” certain routes), and how efficiently those flights occur (in terms of delayed departure and delayed arrival).
